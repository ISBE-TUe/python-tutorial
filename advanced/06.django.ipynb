    "In this tutorial, we will set up a simple Django project. This tutorial is based on the basic intro tutorial that is made available by Django in this location: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/ (Django Getting Started). The first steps in this tutorial (setup) are the same, however, we will model a website that displays 'students' participating in a number of 'courses.\n",

    "Setting up a good draft Django project is not easy, and requires several steps. After doing the below tutorial, you should have the file structure and project as available here: https://github.com/ISBE-TUe/python-tutorial/tree/main/advanced/django/universityProject. Another reference Django project can be found in https://github.com/ISBE-TUe/DUTO-BIM-Projectresultaten/tree/main/3.%20DUTO-BIM%20Validator/3.%20Validatietool (see https://github.com/ISBE-TUe/DUTO-BIM-Projectresultaten/ for general information about that project).\n",

    "To achieve the initial setup, a few steps need to be taken. First, it is recommended to setup a local project on your laptop (and thus not work with these Python notebooks), using Visual Studio Code. Within this local project, you are strongly recommended to set up a `virtual environment` and activate it. If you don't know how to do this, then please use the following resources to get you started: https://github.com/ISBE-TUe/python-tutorial/tree/main/advanced/files/PythonSetup.\n",

    "### 6.1.2 Installing Django\n",
    "After you have set up this project folder, your second step is to install Django. You ideally do this only AFTER creating and activating the above virtual environment, such that Django is installed locally in your project folder. To install Django in your project folder, you have to execute the following command in the command line terminal in visual studio:"
