    "In this tutorial, we will set up a simple Django project. This tutorial is based on the basic intro tutorial that is made available by Django in this location: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/ (Django Getting Started). The first steps in this tutorial (setup) are the same, however, we will model a website that displays 'students' participating in a number of 'courses.\n",

After doing the below tutorial, you should have the file structure and project as available here: https://github.com/ISBE-TUe/python-tutorial/tree/main/advanced/django/universityProject. Another reference Django project can be found in https://github.com/ISBE-TUe/DUTO-BIM-Projectresultaten/tree/main/3.%20DUTO-BIM%20Validator/3.%20Validatietool (see https://github.com/ISBE-TUe/DUTO-BIM-Projectresultaten/ for general information about that project).\n",

    "To achieve the initial setup, a few steps need to be taken. First, it is recommended to setup a local project on your laptop (and thus not work with these Python notebooks), using Visual Studio Code. Within this local project, you are strongly recommended to set up a `virtual environment` and activate it. If you don't know how to do this, then please use the following resources to get you started: https://github.com/ISBE-TUe/python-tutorial/tree/main/advanced/files/PythonSetup.\n",

To install Django in your project folder, you have to execute the following command in the command line terminal in visual studio:"
