    "\n",
    "1. Open the Command Line Interface\n",
    "2. Enable the Python interpreter prompt (`>>`) by typing `python` and enter.\n",

    "A second method to run a Python script, is to collect your python commands in a `.py` file, and then execute the complete `.py` file.\n",
    "1. Create a folder to save your code\n",
    "2. Create a python file called `myFirstScript.py`. Always use the extension .py for a Python script file.\n",

    "Variables are containers for storing values. In Python, we assign variables by using the equals sign (`=`). Variables can hold data of many types such as text, numbers, sequences, boolean. Python has no command for declaring a variable (unlike other programming languages). A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set. When naming variables, you cannot use reserved keywords. Variables can’t have spaces or symbols in their names other than an underscore (_). They can’t begin with numbers but they can have numbers after the first letter."
