    "## Variables\n",
    "Programming languages offer a method of storing data for reuse. Variables are containers for storing values. In Python, we assign variables by using the equals sign (=). Variables can hold data of many types such as text, numbers, sequences, boolean. Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set. When naming variable, you cannot use reserved keywords."
